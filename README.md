# Popularity of Harvard's Courses by Department

This repo contains my code for a graph that depicts the 16 Harvard departments with the largest change (increase or decrease) in the percentage of students enrolled in their courses from Spring 2018 to Spring 2019. 

The data I used is from the Harvard Registrar's Office website: https://registrar.fas.harvard.edu/faculty-staff/courses/enrollment

You can also access the graph on my RPubs: http://rpubs.com/dashamet/harvard_departments
